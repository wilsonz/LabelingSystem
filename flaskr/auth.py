# A Blueprint is a way to organize a group of related views and other code.
# Rather than registering views and other code directly with an app,
# they are registered with a blueprint.
# Then the blueprint is registered with the app when it is available in
# the factory function.

# Flaskr will have two blueprints
# one for authentication func, and another one for the blog posts func.
